# JuMP

JuMP is a modeling interface and a collection of supporting packages for mathematical optimization that is embedded in Julia. With JuMP, users formulate various classes of optimization problems with easy-to-read code, and then solve these problems using state-of-the-art open-source and commercial solvers. JuMP also makes advanced optimization techniques easily accessible from a high-level language.

## Project Ideas

###  New and Updated Example Notebooks 

#### Abstract

With the upcoming v0.19 update to JuMP many example notebooks need to be updated. This is also a great opportunity to add new examples and improve their accessibility.

#### Technical Details

Long description of the project. **Should** include all technical details of the
projects like libraries involved. Please also link to relevant docs / issues / theory /
papers for your project if available.

#### Helpful Experience

List of background experience that we would like / expect from the student.

#### First steps

Students doesn't need to do this before Google Summer of Code code period starts
but will be good if they do just because they will be sure if this is how they
want to spend the summer.
